This is the 'README' file for XDF (the Exquisite `df') from <botao.org>

Xdf is a 'souped-up' version of df(1).

It features flexible selection of status details, size units, and output format/encoding ;

Also, it automatically skips nfs/tmpfs filesystems, thus giving a good idea of "local/physical" disk usage ;

Building could hardly be simpler; just

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

- and you're done, gnu-style (*).

Xdf was created in a bit of a hurry,
so the 'to do' file has plenty of tasks.
